Compilation Information:

You must have Maven and the JDK installed.

Before you can run 'mvn package', change to the differ-libs-from-source directory and run 'mvn install'

The other commands below should be run from the root directory (./differ)
To package the Differ application into a .war (which is by default placed in ./bin) and compile all plugins:
 
	mvn package
	
	This produces a plugin directory and resources directory in the bin folder. Those should be placed into ~/.differ (%USERPROFILE%/.differ on Windows). A WAR is also
	produced, which should be used in the appropriate configuration for your webserver.
	
To compile the Differ application without packaging:

	mvn compile
	
To update the widgetsets without running a full compile:

	mvn vaadin:update-widgetset
	
To compile as needed and run on a local Jetty server first run mvn:package and then:
	
	mvn jetty:run-war
	
	Passing a terminator control character to the console you initiated the server from shuts down the server. [Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z on most platforms]

To remove all build files:
	
	mvn clean
