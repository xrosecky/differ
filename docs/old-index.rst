Introduction
------------

The Image Validator helps an user with transformation of an image 
from one format to another one.

Sometimes it is necessary to convert an image from one format into another format. 
Some distorsions or error effects can occur when transforming of an image.

The Image Validator gives user the information whether a graphic information that 
an image carries was destroyed or not after the transformation.

The Image Validator collects significant properties from various image data extractors,
process them and shows them to a user so that he or she can easily compare two images and controls 
a tranformation process.
