** OPEN jpylyzer - create unittest to check whether all significant properties are mapped right way
 - see appCtx-differ-cmdline.xml. It is main source.
 
 So there is bean metadataExtractors.
 See where it is used.
 
 There is jpylyzerMetadataExtractor in the file.
 It will be called in a unittest to get output.
 
 - please see, what structure the output is.
 
 There is ArraySet extractorProperties, identificationProperties, validationProperties, characterizationProperties in a file metadataSignificantProperties.
 All of them will be checked in the unittest.
 
 - Choose two images that jpylyzer can recognize. See property supportedFileExtensions in a file jpylyzerMetadataExtractor.
 - call jpylyzer by hand and try to recognize what values of significant properties the extractor gives.
 - save the values of significant properties for a given image into some structure. I think you can create spring application context for junit.
 - write junit test for bean jpylyzerMetadataExtractor to check, whether outputs it gives for a given image are the same as values by hand.
 
 If you have problem with collecting values of significant properties for given image I help you.

** OPEN find one property that jpylyzer shows and that is not mapped yet

: There are a lot of properties that program must collects and normalizes.
: They are stored in ArrayList structure. It is often necessary to select given properties
: by its own name.
: 
: Implementing some kind of index by property name must speed up an aplication.
: At least ArrayHash by property name could help.

: It is difficult to observe all properties that metadata extractors offer.
: So it is possible that some of properties remain unrecognized and they are not never used.
: 
: It would be great to offer some debug mode when an application shows all unused properties.
: At the end of an iteration (ie. configuration) an application will show no unused property.
